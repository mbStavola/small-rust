# Small Rust

This repo contains a bunch of really small "scripts" written in Rust. 

Partially inspired by Sean Barrett's [Advice for Writing Small Programs in C][stb], but mostly stems from my incredible ability to completely lose all Bash knowledge after closing an `.sh` file.

Some of them do useful things, some of them were just written for fun. Please do not have the expectation that these are written in a super robust fashion; most were written for one-off tasks and experiments.

If you want to play around with these programs, you just need [Rust][rust] and [cargo-eval][cargo-eval].

Be aware that dev work for this repo is done on UNIX-y systems, so they might not work on Windows.
